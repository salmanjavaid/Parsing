WE are past the times when being in possession of a gun was good enough security and a sufficient statement of power. Even the gunman and the police escorts have long since failed in their duty of deterring criminals and creating awe. 
The Nawab Raisanis of our times cannot settle for just anything and certainly not for an ‘unprotected’ vehicle to carry around their briefs for improving the lot of the people. A bullet-proof vehicle is seen as a prerequisite for many who may, in fact, have a genuine reason to avail of the facility. The figure of ‘only’ 200 bullet-proof vehicles imported during the previous PPP government is evidence that not everyone who is rich or influential opted for extra security worth a ‘few’ millions.

Nevertheless, the issue is not about whether or not those who are in positions of power and influence have a right to better protection. Instead of the 200 vehicles allowed into the country, a good proportion of them free of customs duty, those with clout or money could have had 2,000. Whether they need them or not, they can have, and flaunt, their fortified palaces and vehicles. That debate is not the main one. The debate is that, in a country faced with extreme dangers, what services have these better-protected souls — many of them elected to serve the people — been able to offer to the public? But then, on second thoughts, privileges bring their own ‘hazards’, and the privileged and the especially protected are always exposed to jabs from the envious, grudging crowd around them. A failure to 
deliver some kind of relief to the people further distinguishes the powerful few from the rest and makes them a subject of public ridicule and scorn.
